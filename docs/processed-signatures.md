## Notes

- **Download**: Click the "Download" button to access the signature files hosted on Figshare.
- **Cell Type Levels**: Each signature includes hierarchical levels:
  - **Level 1 (Major)**: Broad categories like epithelial, immune, and stromal.
  - **Level 2 (Subtypes)**: Subclassifications such as basal cells, T cells, etc.
  - **Level 3 (Detailed)**: Highly detailed cell types like CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CAFs.

> **Note**: Replace all placeholders with the actual dataset details. This page will be updated as new signatures are processed.

### How to Use
1. Select the desired signature from the table above.
2. Click the **Download** button to access the file.
3. Use the appropriate level based on your analysis requirements:
   - **Level 1**: Broad deconvolution tasks.
   - **Level 2**: Subtype-specific investigations.
   - **Level 3**: Detailed cell population studies.
4. Refer to the [Tutorial] for guidance on using these signatures in your workflows.
